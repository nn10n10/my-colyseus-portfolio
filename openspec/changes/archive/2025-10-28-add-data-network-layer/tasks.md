## 1. Infrastructure Security Setup
- [x] 1.1 Create Application Load Balancer security group with inbound port 80/443 rules
- [x] 1.2 Update ECS service security group to allow traffic from ALB security group
- [x] 1.3 Create ElastiCache security group with Redis-specific rules
- [x] 1.4 Create security group rules for VPC endpoints access

## 2. Data Layer Implementation
- [x] 2.1 Create ElastiCache Redis subnet group using private subnets
- [x] 2.2 Deploy ElastiCache Redis cluster (cache.m5.large or appropriate size)
- [x] 2.3 Create DynamoDB tables for user data and game state
- [x] 2.4 Configure DynamoDB auto-scaling policies

## 3. Network Connectivity
- [x] 3.1 Create VPC gateway endpoints for DynamoDB (com.amazonaws.ap-northeast-1.dynamodb)
- [x] 3.2 Create VPC interface endpoints for ElastiCache
- [x] 3.3 Create Application Load Balancer in public subnets
- [x] 3.4 Configure ALB target group for ECS service (port 2567)
- [x] 3.5 Set up ALB listener with HTTP to HTTPS redirect (phase 4 for HTTPS)

## 4. IAM and Permissions
- [x] 4.1 Update ECS task role with permissions for ElastiCache access
- [x] 4.2 Update ECS task role with permissions for DynamoDB operations
- [x] 4.3 Add VPC endpoint IAM policies where required

## 5. Integration and Validation
- [x] 5.1 Update ECS service to use ALB for external connectivity
- [x] 5.2 Test Redis connectivity from ECS task
- [x] 5.3 Test DynamoDB operations from ECS task
- [x] 5.4 Verify ALB can successfully route traffic to ECS service
- [x] 5.5 Run terraform validate and plan to ensure no configuration errors

## 6. Documentation and Cleanup
- [x] 6.1 Update infrastructure documentation with new resources
- [x] 6.2 Add connection strings and endpoints to application configuration
- [x] 6.3 Clean up any temporary or test resources created during development
