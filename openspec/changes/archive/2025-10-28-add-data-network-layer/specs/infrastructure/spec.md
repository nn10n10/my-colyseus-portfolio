## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Application Load Balancer Integration
The system SHALL provide an Application Load Balancer to distribute external traffic to the ECS service across multiple availability zones.

#### Scenario: External client access
- **WHEN** external clients attempt to connect to the game server
- **THEN** traffic is routed through the ALB to healthy ECS tasks
- **AND** the connection is load balanced across availability zones

#### Scenario: Health check routing
- **WHEN** an ECS task becomes unhealthy
- **THEN** the ALB stops routing traffic to the unhealthy task
- **AND** continues routing to healthy tasks in the service

### Requirement: VPC Endpoints for Private Connectivity
The system SHALL provide VPC endpoints for secure private connectivity to AWS services without traversing the public internet.

#### Scenario: DynamoDB private access
- **WHEN** the ECS task needs to access DynamoDB
- **THEN** traffic flows through VPC gateway endpoints
- **AND** no public internet routing is required

#### Scenario: ElastiCache private access
- **WHEN** the ECS task needs to access Redis cache
- **THEN** traffic flows through VPC interface endpoints
- **AND** connectivity remains within the AWS network

### Requirement: Enhanced Security Group Configuration
The system SHALL implement precise security group rules to control traffic between all infrastructure components.

#### Scenario: ALB to ECS traffic
- **WHEN** traffic flows from ALB to ECS service
- **THEN** only traffic on port 2567 (Colyseus default) is allowed
- **AND** only from the ALB security group source

#### Scenario: Database access control
- **WHEN** ECS tasks access data services
- **THEN** only required protocols and ports are permitted
- **AND** access is restricted to specific security groups

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: ECS Service Networking Configuration
The ECS service SHALL be updated to integrate with the Application Load Balancer for external traffic management.

#### Scenario: Service registration with ALB
- **WHEN** ECS service is deployed
- **THEN** it registers with the ALB target group
- **AND** health checks are configured for the application port (2567)

#### Scenario: External connectivity through ALB
- **WHEN** clients connect to the application
- **THEN** all traffic flows through the ALB
- **AND** no direct access to ECS tasks from the internet
