## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Public-Facing Load Balancer
The system SHALL provide an Application Load Balancer deployed in public subnets to handle external traffic from game clients.

#### Scenario: Client connection establishment
- **WHEN** game clients attempt to connect to the multiplayer game server
- **THEN** the ALB receives connections on standard HTTP/HTTPS ports
- **AND** forwards traffic to the appropriate ECS service

#### Scenario: Traffic distribution across availability zones
- **WHEN** clients connect from different geographic regions
- **THEN** the ALB distributes traffic to healthy ECS tasks in multiple AZs
- **AND** maintains session affinity for WebSocket connections

#### Scenario: SSL termination (Phase 4 preparation)
- **WHEN** HTTPS is configured (Phase 4)
- **THEN** the ALB handles SSL termination
- **AND** forwards decrypted traffic to ECS service

### Requirement: Private Network Connectivity
The system SHALL ensure all data services (ElastiCache, DynamoDB) are accessible only through private network connections within the VPC.

#### Scenario: Database traffic isolation
- **WHEN** ECS tasks access database services
- **THEN** traffic flows through private subnets
- **AND** no direct internet access is required or permitted

#### Scenario: VPC endpoint utilization
- **WHEN** AWS services are accessed from ECS tasks
- **THEN** VPC endpoints provide private connectivity
- **AND** traffic remains within the AWS network infrastructure

### Requirement: Network Security and Access Control
The system SHALL implement security groups that enforce precise network access controls between all components.

#### Scenario: ALB to ECS traffic control
- **WHEN** traffic flows from ALB to ECS service
- **THEN** security groups allow only the application port (2567)
- **AND** restrict access to traffic originating from the ALB

#### Scenario: Database access security
- **WHEN** ECS tasks access ElastiCache or DynamoDB
- **THEN** security groups allow only required database protocols
- **AND** restrict access to ECS service security group

#### Scenario: Internet access restriction
- **WHEN** private resources attempt to access the internet directly
- **THEN** security groups block direct internet access
- **AND** only allow outbound traffic through NAT or VPC endpoints

### Requirement: Multi-AZ High Availability
The system SHALL ensure network resources are distributed across multiple availability zones for high availability.

#### Scenario: ALB availability zone distribution
- **WHEN** the ALB is deployed
- **THEN** it spans multiple public subnets in different AZs
- **AND** can route traffic to healthy targets in any AZ

#### Scenario: Failover handling
- **WHEN** an availability zone becomes unavailable
- **THEN** the ALB automatically stops routing to affected targets
- **AND** continues serving traffic from remaining healthy AZs
