## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: ElastiCache Redis Integration
The system SHALL provide an ElastiCache Redis cluster for real-time session state management and low-latency data operations.

#### Scenario: Game room state synchronization
- **WHEN** multiple players are in the same game room
- **THEN** game state changes are synchronized through Redis
- **AND** updates occur with sub-millisecond latency

#### Scenario: Player session management
- **WHEN** players connect or disconnect from the game
- **THEN** session data is stored and retrieved from Redis
- **AND** session state remains consistent across server restarts

#### Scenario: Cache for frequently accessed data
- **WHEN** game servers need access to hot data (leaderboards, player stats)
- **THEN** data is cached in Redis for fast retrieval
- **AND** cache misses trigger database queries and cache population

### Requirement: DynamoDB Persistent Storage
The system SHALL provide DynamoDB tables for durable storage of user data, game statistics, and persistent game state.

#### Scenario: User profile persistence
- **WHEN** player creates or updates their profile
- **THEN** profile data is stored in DynamoDB users table
- **AND** data is available across all game sessions and server restarts

#### Scenario: Game history and statistics
- **WHEN** a game session completes
- **THEN** game results and statistics are recorded in DynamoDB
- **AND** historical data is available for leaderboards and analytics

#### Scenario: Persistent game state
- **WHEN** game servers need to save long-term game state
- **THEN** state is serialized and stored in DynamoDB
- **AND** can be retrieved and restored in future sessions

### Requirement: Database Access Permissions
The system SHALL provide IAM permissions allowing ECS tasks to access ElastiCache and DynamoDB with least-privilege access.

#### Scenario: Redis access authorization
- **WHEN** ECS tasks attempt to connect to Redis
- **THEN** IAM permissions allow network-level access
- **AND** connection is established through VPC endpoints

#### Scenario: DynamoDB operations authorization
- **WHEN** ECS tasks perform database operations
- **THEN** IAM permissions allow specific actions (GetItem, PutItem, UpdateItem, etc.)
- **AND** access is restricted to specific tables and operations
