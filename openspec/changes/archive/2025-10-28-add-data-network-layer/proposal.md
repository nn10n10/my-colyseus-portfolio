## Why

The current infrastructure includes basic VPC networking and ECS service with containerized Colyseus application, but lacks the essential data layer and external connectivity required for production-grade real-time multiplayer gaming. Phase 3 needs to integrate ElastiCache (Redis) for session state management, DynamoDB for persistent data storage, and an Application Load Balancer to provide secure public access with proper traffic routing.

## What Changes

- Add ElastiCache (Redis) cluster for real-time state synchronization and session management
- Create DynamoDB tables for persistent game data and user information
- Implement Application Load Balancer with proper security groups for external traffic access
- Add VPC endpoints for secure, private connectivity to AWS services
- Configure security groups for precise access control between services
- Add necessary IAM permissions for ECS tasks to access data services

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: infrastructure, database, networking capabilities
- **Affected code**: infrastructure/*.tf files will be expanded with new resources
- **Architecture**: Changes will complete the core backend infrastructure as shown in the target architecture diagram
- **Security**: Introduces defense-in-depth with private connectivity and precise security group rules
