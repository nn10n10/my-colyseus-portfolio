## Context

Phase 2 successfully established the foundational network infrastructure (VPC, subnets, ECS) and containerized the Colyseus application. However, a real-time multiplayer game server requires:

1. **Low-latency state synchronization** - Game rooms need to sync state across all connected players with minimal delay
2. **Persistent data storage** - User profiles, game statistics, and persistent game state need durable storage
3. **External connectivity** - Game clients need a secure, scalable entry point to connect to game servers
4. **Security by design** - All data services must be accessible only from authorized application components

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals:
- Integrate Redis for sub-millisecond session state and real-time data operations
- Implement DynamoDB for durable storage of user data and game history
- Provide secure public access through Application Load Balancer with proper routing
- Ensure all AWS services communicate through VPC endpoints when possible
- Maintain high availability with Multi-AZ deployment of all critical services
- Implement least-privilege security model with precise security group rules

### Non-Goals:
- CloudFront CDN integration (this is Phase 4)
- Auto-scaling policies based on game-specific metrics
- Advanced monitoring and alerting configurations
- CI/CD pipeline setup (this is Phase 4)

## Decisions

### Database Selection
- **Decision**: Use ElastiCache (Redis) for session/state management, DynamoDB for persistent data
- **Rationale**: Redis provides sub-millisecond latency crucial for real-time gaming; DynamoDB offers seamless scaling with no operational overhead
- **Alternatives considered**: Self-hosted Redis (operational burden), RDS (overkill for simple game data, higher cost)

### Network Architecture
- **Decision**: Place ALB in public subnets, ECS/ElastiCache/DynamoDB in private subnets with VPC endpoints
- **Rationale**: Provides defense-in-depth while ensuring low-latency internal communication
- **Alternatives considered**: All services in public subnets (security risk), NAT gateway for outbound (additional cost vs VPC endpoints)

### Access Control
- **Decision**: Security groups with protocol/port-specific rules + VPC endpoints for private connectivity
- **Rationale**: Defense-in-depth approach, reduces attack surface, eliminates internet dependency for service communication
- **Alternatives considered**: Only network ACLs (less granular), only IAM policies (no network-level protection)

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Performance
- **Risk**: Network latency between ALB and ECS could impact real-time game performance
- **Mitigation**: Place all services in same VPC, use Multi-AZ placement, enable VPC endpoints

### Security
- **Risk**: Exposing game server through ALB increases attack surface
- **Mitigation**: WAF integration in Phase 4, strict security group rules, only expose required ports

### Cost
- **Risk**: Multiple AWS services increase operational costs
- **Mitigation**: Serverless components where possible, appropriate sizing, monitoring for optimization opportunities

### Complexity
- **Risk**: Multiple interconnected services increase system complexity
- **Mitigation**: Clear separation of concerns, comprehensive logging, infrastructure as code for reproducibility

## Migration Plan

### Phase 3 Implementation Steps:
1. Create security groups for ALB, ECS, ElastiCache, and DynamoDB access
2. Deploy ElastiCache Redis cluster in private subnets
3. Create DynamoDB tables for game data
4. Set up VPC endpoints for DynamoDB and ElastiCache
5. Deploy Application Load Balancer with target group for ECS service
6. Update ECS task role permissions for data service access
7. Test end-to-end connectivity and game functionality

### Rollback Strategy:
- Maintain current working configuration
- Each service can be added/removed independently
- Terraform state management allows selective resource destruction

## Open Questions

- Should we implement Redis cluster mode for high availability, or start with single instance and upgrade later?
- DynamoDB table structure for game state - should we use single-table design or separate tables for different data types?
- ALB health check configuration for WebSocket connections (Colyseus uses WebSocket protocol)
- VPC endpoint cost optimization - which services benefit most from private connectivity?
